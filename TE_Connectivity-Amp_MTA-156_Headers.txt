This ZIP file should contain three files:
-this text file, "TE_Connectivity-Amp_MTA-156_Headers.txt"
-"AMP.lib", a DipTrace library file of PC layout patterns for the connectors
-"AMP_MTA156.eli", a DipTrace eli file of schematic components for the connectors

Put the two DipTrace files into your DipTrace\lib directory, or
other directory of your choice, and you should be able to add
them to the set of libraries available in your schematic editor.

These connectors are commonly used for power connections
(including connections to power sinks/loads, as well as sources)
to external devices.  These connectors are documented in data
sheets from TE Connectivity/Amp.  The TE Connectivity/AMP
data sheets referenced while building these patterns were:

C-640387, rev AE1 (ENG_CD_640387_AE1.pdf)
C-640389, rev AD1 (ENG_CD_640389_AD1.pdf)
C-640455, rev AD (ENG_CD_640455_AD.pdf)

The data sheets recommend 0.070 +.010/-.000 holes on 0.063 thick
p.c. board material (dimensions in inches).  They also note, "One
hole may be undersized (.065/.060) for assembly retention during
wave soldering."

I've attached a "mtg note" to each component, listing the
recommended setback from the board edge (for the centerline of
the row of holes) for use when mated with MTA-156 connectors.
For use when mated with SL-156 connectors, the following
recommendations for setback from the board edge apply:
640387:  0.500 minimum
640389:  0.325-0.345
640455:  0.175 minimum (same as for mating with MTA-156 connectors.)

You will find, for each pattern, that the silk layer shows
the plastic part of the connector, and the assembly layer
shows the plastic part and the pins.  Since the pins
may go beyond the edge of the board, I wanted to avoid
putting them on the silk layer.

I would appreciate knowing about any errors you find in these
files.
